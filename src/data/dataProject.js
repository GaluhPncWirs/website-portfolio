      "Designing a nutritional analysis system called Nutrigoood, which is based on OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract information from food or beverage labels. This system is capable of recognizing text such as ingredient composition, sugar content, calories, and other nutritional information from product label images. After the data is extracted, the system analyzes and predicts nutritional values based on a machine learning model that has been developed, providing users with insights into the balance of their consumption. This application is designed to support a healthy lifestyle by leveraging image processing technology and nutritional analysis. This project is a capstone project from the Independent Study program, one of which is through Bangkit Academy. In its implementation, the project was collaboratively carried out by six team members with different learning paths, such as Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, and Mobile Development.",

      "Building a website based online exam application designed to simplify the learning evaluation process. This system provides two types of exams, namely multiple choice and essay, with question management features, question marking, and exam result storage. This application was developed using the Next.js framework, TypeScript, TailwindCSS & shadcn ui, and Supabase database. From a technical standpoint, the system has been implemented using a component based architecture and React Hooks, and applies middleware for page access security. The application is also fully responsive, ensuring an optimal user experience across various devices. To maintain exam integrity, the system is equipped with security features such as copy-paste prevention on questions, restrictions on moving or exiting the exam page, and restrictions on re-access after the exam has started. With a combination of technology and robust security features, this system provides an efficient and reliable solution for conducting online exams.",
