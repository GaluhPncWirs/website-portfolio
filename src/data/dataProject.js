      "A web-based application to help determine the safe limits of consumption of packaged sweet drinks based on the user's daily sugar intake. This is my final thesis project. The system is equipped with an easy-to-understand visual display. This project has also undergone usability evaluation to ensure ease of use for the general public. The application was built using Next.js, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript, and stores data using Firebase. The research findings have been published in an academic journal and are accessible in the JISA(Jurnal Informatika dan Sains)",

      "Designing a nutritional analysis system called Nutrigoood, which is based on OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract information from food or beverage labels. This system is capable of recognizing text such as ingredient composition, sugar content, calories, and other nutritional information from product label images. After the data is extracted, the system analyzes and predicts nutritional values based on a machine learning model that has been developed, providing users with insights into the balance of their consumption. This application is designed to support a healthy lifestyle by leveraging image processing technology and nutritional analysis. This project is a capstone project from the Independent Study program, one of which is through Bangkit Academy. In its implementation, the project was collaboratively carried out by six team members with different learning paths, such as Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, and Mobile Development.",
